            <h1>About the game</h1>

            <p>SYNCH/RUSH was intially designed for PC and mobile. The aim was to create a fun platformer that could
                seamlessly switch between solo and cooperative play, while remaining accessible and easy to pick up.</p>
            <p>Consequently, SYNCH/RUSH's gameplay operates on a 2 button system to control Zuum, the game's playable
                character. Zuum can bounce between the top and bottom platforms to avoid oncoming obstacles. In certain
                modes, the button to jump changes depending on Zuum's position. The player(s) switch back and forth
                between the buttons to emulated the bouncing between platforms. This enables the seamless co-op aspects
                as 2 players can use 1 button each and coordinate to control Zuum. </p>

            <p> There are 6 total gameplay modes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 Player modes:
                    <ul>
                        <li> <span>SYNCH mode</span> - bouncing between platforms to avoid obstacles</li>
                        <li> <span>Blast mode</span> - one button used to bounce between platforms, the over activates a
                            shockwave
                            blast to destroy large walls which cannot be avoided</li>
                        <li><span>Smash-Up mode</span> - Level with gameplay alternating between SYNCH and Blast modes
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Challenge mode</span> - Smash-Up mode but the level continues endlessly until the
                            player(s) runs
                            out of lives</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    4 Player modes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>RUSH mode</span> - First to the finish line. Hitting obstacles places your team behind
                            the other.</li>
                        <li><span>Disco mode</span> - Collect the most points for your team by colliding with walls
                            matching your team colours and avoid the walls with the opposing team's colours.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h1>My Work</h1>

            <p>SYNCH/RUSH was a solo project. As such, all of the work on the game was done by myself, with the
                exception of certain sounds and sprite works.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>

            <p>I designed and implemented all gameplay aspects. I developed the 6 core game mode, implementing the
                levels, player character, power ups, pause, win/loss states, and level end screen.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-block">

        <div class="linebreak"></div>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>Levels</h2>

            <p>The levels were developed by creating multiple level "chunks" prefabs. These prefabs contain
                approximately 10 - 15 seconds of a level. On load, environments are generated by attaching multiple
                chunk prefabs together to create one continous level. The order is randomly generated daily for the
                SYNCH, Blast, and Smash-Up game modes to coincide with their daily bonus features. The other modes are
                randomised every time on load. Challenge mode runs infinitely by continuously loading a new chunk to the
                end of the level, and removing the first chunk once off screen.</p>

            <h2>Controls</h2>

            <p>The controls are fully rebindable, including gamepad support. This was enabled with Unity's new Input
                System.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>In-game Shop</h2>

            <p>I added an in-game shop and point system where players could purchase cosmetic skins for Zuum. Currently
                there are 4 skins including the base one. The player's choices are monitored locally through
                PlayerPrefs.</p>

            <h2>Visuals</h2>

            <p>I designed and created Zuum, the player character with a combination of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
                The cosmetic skins and menu items were also created this way. The levels were created using Unity sprite
                assets. I used the Universal Render Pipeline together with Shader Graphs to achieve the neon glow on the
                levels, as well as the shockwave blast.</p>

            <h2>Network</h2>

            <p>I am currently in the process of establishing mulitplayer gameplay over network using Photon Unity Networking. The intention is to contain all the gameplay features of local multiplayer in a networked environment. I have currently completed a tech demo that allows players to join a lobby together to play one level. This is currently not optimised.</p>
