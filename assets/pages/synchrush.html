            <p>I developed SYNCH/RUSH during my final year of my Bachelor's degree over the course of 8 months. The game
                is an auto-run platformer with seamless cooperative integration, complete with 6 different game mode,
                including 2 modes for up to 4 players.</p>

            <p>SYNCH/RUSH was intially designed for PC and mobile. The aim was to create a fun platformer that could
                seamlessly switch between solo and cooperative play, while remaining accessible and easy to pick up.</p>
            <p>Consequently, SYNCH/RUSH's gameplay operates on a 2 button system to control Zuum, the game's playable
                character. Zuum can bounce between the top and bottom platforms to avoid oncoming obstacles. In certain
                modes, the button to jump changes depending on Zuum's position. The player(s) switch back and forth
                between the buttons to emulated the bouncing between platfors. This enables the seamless co-op aspects
                as 2 players can use 1 button each and coordinate to control Zuum. </p>

            <p> There are 6 total gameplay modes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 Player modes:
                    <ul>
                        <li> <span>SYNCH mode</span> - bouncing between platforms to avoid obstacles</li>
                        <li> <span>Blast mode</span> - one button used to bounce between platforms, the over activates a shockwave
                            blast to destroy large walls which cannot be avoided</li>
                        <li><span>Smash-Up mode</span> - Level with gameplay alternating between SYNCH and Blast modes</li>
                        <li><span>Challenge mode</span> - Smash-Up mode but the level continues endlessly until the player(s) runs
                            out of lives</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    4 Player modes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>RUSH mode</span> - First to the finish line. Hitting obstacles places your team behind the other.</li>
                        <li><span>Disco mode</span> - Collect the most points for your team by colliding with walls matching your team colours and avoid the walls with the opposing team's colours.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>
