            <p>Cupric was developed with 2 others during the 2nd year of my Bachelors'. The game is a 2D isometric action game. When the game starts, the player's village will be destroyed by evil robots in 7 in-game days. Players must venture out, defeating robots to gain upgrades for themselves and their village, in order to survive attack.</p>

            <p>I was in charge of programming and I contributed a lot to the design of the game. The aim was to create a game with a defining end point, to provide a sense of progression to the game. Alongside this, we attempted to inject meaningful decisions into the game in the form of the upgrade system, where player can spend their collecting metal scraps to upgrade themselves or the village. During the final attack, upgrading the village will ensure the village stays standing for longer, while upgrading the player character will make the player's capabilities stronger.</p>

            <p>The game's upgrade system and in-game ecenomy are built using the PlayerPrefs utility in Unity to keep track of the player's resources, their chosen upgrades, and the days until the robot attack. </p>
